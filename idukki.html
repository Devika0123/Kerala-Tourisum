                <h6>Idukki Arch Dam, an engineering marvel, is located in the South-Indian state of Kerala. It is an arch dam with a double curvature and is built on River Periyar. Precisely, the dam is constructed in a gorge between two hills, Kuravathi and Kuravan. It is at the height of about 550 feet and is a breathtaking sight in the otherwise rugged terrain along which has been built.
