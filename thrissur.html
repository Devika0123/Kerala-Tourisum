                </h2>
                <br>
                <h6>On the outskirts of the city at a distance of some 60 km, the Athirappilly waterfalls mark one of the best places to visit in Thrissur. Standing 80 ft tall and about 330 ft wide, these falls are the largest in the state of Kerala.

                    The majesty of this place can be understood by the fact that the falls are located on the Chalakudy River, that originates from the highest mountain in India outside of the Himalayas. A perfect place for a group outing, these falls are sometimes called the Niagra of India
