        </div>
        <br>
        <h3>Like the rest of Kerala, Kollam is climactically temperate with a generally sunny weather peaking in heat during April-May.
            The heart land of Kollam is naturally veined by the Ashtamudi lake, a massive, multi-branched water body, which is also a popular boating attraction for tourists.
             This and the Kollam canal cutting through the city give Kollam a place of prominence in the waterway systems of the country. A number of islands of varying sizes beautifully spot the vast expanse of the lake.
              The city is graced by beaches where people go to spend quiet evenings. Kollam also has a considerably large forest cover on its eastern side making home for several eco tourism projects like Shenduruni, Thenmala, Palaruvi etc.
