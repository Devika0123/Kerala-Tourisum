        <h3>Called the ‘Evergreen city of India’, Thiruvananthapuram is the capital of the state of Kerala.
             The city comprises beautiful beaches, long stretches of palm fringed shorelines, windy backwaters and historical structures.
              Along with its natural and historical significance, the city is also popular for its ancient temples that are renowned for their architecture making Thiruvananthapuram one of the most visited pilgrim centers of India.

                <h2>Ponmudi</h2>
                <br>
                <h6>Locals in the capital city of Thiruvananthapuram will declare that a weekend drive to Ponmudi is among the best ways to spend time in the city.
                    The temperature is equable throughout the year and the three hour drive from the city is justified once the valley comes into view. 
                    The tree house view tower is another great place to visit. Ponmudi is indeed a rising hotbed of tourist activity. A hill so close to the city, yet nestled so near the protective arms of the sea.
